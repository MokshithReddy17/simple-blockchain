# Blockchain Simulation

## Overview
This project is a **Blockchain Simulation** designed to demonstrate the fundamental principles of blockchain technology, including block creation, hashing, proof of work, and transaction validation.

## Features
- **Block Creation**: Generates blocks containing transaction data.
- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: Implements a mining process to validate blocks.
- **Cryptographic Hashing**: Uses SHA-256 hashing to ensure block integrity.
- **Peer-to-Peer Network (Optional)**: Simulates decentralized node communication.
- **Transaction Handling**: Allows users to create and verify transactions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mokshithreddy17/blockchain-simulation.git
   cd blockchain-simulation
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # For Python-based implementation
   npm install  # For JavaScript-based implementation (if applicable)
   ```
3. Run the simulation:
   ```sh
   python main.py  # Python
   node main.js  # JavaScript
   ```

## Usage
- Run the main script to start the blockchain simulation.
- Add transactions and mine blocks to see the blockchain in action.
- Validate the blockchain by checking hashes and block links.

## Technologies Used
- **Python / JavaScript** for blockchain logic
- **Flask / Express.js** (Optional) for API interactions
- **SHA-256** for cryptographic hashing

## Future Enhancements
- Implement a **consensus mechanism** (e.g., PoS, DPoS)
- Add a **wallet and digital signature** for secure transactions
- Create a **user-friendly interface** for better interaction
- Introduce **smart contract capabilities**
